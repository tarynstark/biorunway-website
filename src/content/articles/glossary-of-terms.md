# BioRunway Glossary: Essential Terms at the Intersection of Biotech and Fashion

The convergence of biotechnology and fashion has created an entirely new vocabulary that spans scientific research, manufacturing processes, and sustainable design principles. Whether you're an industry professional, investor, or simply curious about the future of fashion, understanding these terms is essential for navigating this rapidly evolving landscape.

This comprehensive glossary defines the key concepts, technologies, and processes that are reshaping how we create, produce, and think about fashion materials.

## A

**Aerobic Fermentation**  
A biological process where microorganisms break down organic matter in the presence of oxygen, often used to produce bio-based materials and dyes. Companies like Bolt Threads use aerobic fermentation to create mycelium-based leather alternatives.

**Algae-Based Materials**  
Textiles and materials derived from various species of algae, including both microalgae and macroalgae (seaweed). These materials can be processed into fibers, dyes, or plastic alternatives. AlgiKnit is a leading company in this space, creating yarn from kelp.

**Antimicrobial Textiles**  
Fabrics treated or engineered to resist bacterial, viral, or fungal growth. Bio-based antimicrobial treatments often use naturally occurring compounds like chitosan (from crustacean shells) or silver nanoparticles produced by bacteria.

**Biodyes**  
Colorants produced by living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants. Unlike synthetic dyes, biodyes are typically non-toxic and biodegradable, making them environmentally preferable alternatives.

**Biofabrication**  
The process of using biological systems—such as bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells—to grow or produce materials. This can include growing leather-like materials from bacteria or producing silk proteins in yeast.

**Biogenic Materials**  
Materials produced by living organisms or derived from biological processes. This broad category includes everything from spider silk proteins produced in bacteria to calcium carbonate structures grown by mollusks.

**Bio-leather**  
Leather alternatives grown from biological sources, most commonly mycelium (mushroom root networks) or bacterial cellulose. Companies like MycoWorks and Modern Meadow are leaders in this category.

**Biomimetics**  
The practice of learning from and mimicking natural processes, structures, or functions to solve human design challenges. In fashion, this might involve copying the water-repelling properties of lotus leaves or the strength of spider silk.

**Bioplastics**  
Plastics derived from renewable biological sources, such as corn starch, sugarcane, or algae. In fashion, bioplastics are used for accessories, packaging, and synthetic fabric alternatives.

**Biotextiles**  
Textiles produced using biotechnology, either through genetic modification of traditional fiber sources or through entirely biological production methods. This includes both plant-based and microbially-produced fibers.

## C

**Cellular Agriculture**  
The production of agricultural products from cell cultures rather than whole organisms. In fashion, this typically refers to growing materials like leather or fur from animal cells without raising or slaughtering animals.

**Circular Economy**  
An economic model designed to eliminate waste and maximize resource efficiency through closed-loop systems. In biotech fashion, this includes designing materials that can be composted or recycled indefinitely.

**Collagen**  
A protein that provides structure to animal skin, bones, and connective tissues. Biotech companies are producing collagen through fermentation processes to create leather alternatives without animals.

**Cradle-to-Cradle Design**  
A design philosophy that considers the entire lifecycle of a product, ensuring that materials can be safely returned to the environment or reused in new products. This principle guides many biotech fashion innovations.

## D

**Dissolution Recycling**  
A chemical recycling process that breaks down textile materials into their molecular components, which can then be reconstituted into new materials. Some biotech approaches use enzymes to facilitate this process.

**DNA Sequencing**  
The process of determining the order of nucleotides in DNA molecules. In biotech fashion, DNA sequencing is used to identify and optimize organisms that produce useful materials or to verify the authenticity of bio-based products.

## E

**Enzymatic Processing**  
The use of enzymes (biological catalysts) to modify or produce materials. In textiles, enzymes can be used for fabric finishing, dye removal, or breaking down materials for recycling.

**Engineered Living Materials (ELMs)**  
Materials that incorporate living cells programmed to perform specific functions, such as self-repair or environmental responsiveness. These represent the cutting edge of biotech material science.

## F

**Fermentation**  
A metabolic process where microorganisms convert organic compounds into acids, gases, or alcohol. In biotech fashion, fermentation is used to produce everything from silk proteins to leather-like materials.

**Fungal Materials**  
Materials derived from fungi, most commonly mycelium. These can be processed into leather alternatives, packaging materials, or even building materials.

## G

**Genetic Engineering**  
The direct manipulation of an organism's genes to produce desired traits. In biotech fashion, this might involve engineering bacteria to produce spider silk proteins or modifying plants to grow longer fibers.

**Green Chemistry**  
Chemical practices that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. Biotech fashion often employs green chemistry principles to create safer production processes.

## H
